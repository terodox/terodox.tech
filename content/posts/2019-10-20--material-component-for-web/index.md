If you working with design on the web, then chances are very high you've heard of [Google's Material Design System](https://material.io/). This design system has evolved over the years, and gone through at least two major iterations. There are libraries available for all of the major framework. [Vue](https://vuematerial.io/). [React](https://material-ui.com/). Of course [Angular](https://material.angular.io/). But what about just html, css and javascript?

## A dom native solution to complex components

[Material components for web](https://material.io/develop/web/) are the answer to a native approach to build components based on the material design system. They provide the necessary building blocks to build custom components that look, feel and act like material components without requiring a framework.
