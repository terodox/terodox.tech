Any team can be defined by one thing above all others: cohesion. A cohesive team is one that appears to move in lock step toward a goal, while maintaining a high level of passion and happiness, even when working through challenging problems. This is something that can be easily overlooked in a modern agile development environment. I will make the case that team cohesion is the most important part of maintaining a high performing team over the long term.

## A disconnected team can be the downfall of any project

I was working on a android mobile project to deliver a new feature at the same time another member of my team was writing this feature for the web, and yet another member of the team was working on iOS mobile version of the feature. We were all making progress, and the three projects looked and felt reasonably similar to one another. It felt, at the time, like we were crushing this project, but in the end we over committed and underproduced.

This really got to me at the time.  I thought we were taking a great approach by solving the same use case across all platforms at the same time. Unfortunately working on three disparate platforms at the same time actually drove the team away from one another.

We started focusing completely on our own code bases. We still did code reviews, but much of that turned out to be a giant rubber stamp instead of being well understood and in depth. We watched as teams around us began to deliver completed features, one platform at a time, more quickly, and more complete than ours.

The team had become a siloed and disconnected amalgamation of people working in close proximity, but not together.

## An agile team is a relationship and should be treated like one

When we commit to a relationship in our personal life we get to make a choice about who we want to be with. This is obviously not always the case at our jobs. However, this is not reason to believe the interpersonal relationships at our work are any less important than the one we hold outside of work. Growing and bonding as a team can be a game changer for any team.

A team is a group relationship. It requires care and thought in order for it to grow and succeed. Many times this is not a natural occurrence, and requires actual work to accomplish. A team that has bonded at an interpersonal level will have more empathy for one another, be more open in communication, and because of this will resolve conflict much more rapidly.

Conflict resolution is the cornerstone to all relationships. When one or more team members are left with a lasting feeling of discontent after a conflict it is general very caustic. The goal of conflict is to drive creative problem solving, and a team that can resolve conflict quickly will be able to step into and out of a challenging discussion without holding a grudge.
